# .dotfiles (dotdotfiles?)

If somehow you find yourself on my dotfiles repository and you decide "Sick, yet another dotfiles repo! Hey I think this thousandth one is the one I want to clone" you can:

~~~
git clone https://github.com:thisisandrewv/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
cd ~/.dotfiles
./install
~~~


Hopefully I actually keep them organized this time around!

Here are some resources I've used so far:
